#' The purpose of this script is to test different methods for homogenising
#' the cell type labels of reference datasets to match the manual annotation 
#' of the Skull Bone Marrow (SBM) data. This has a number of uses, notably
#' for comparing the results of different datasets/annotation methods on the
#' SBM data.
#' 
#' NOTE : We will most likely be using the SMB data to match labels across 
#' datasets - this may cause a bias (overfitting). It is important to remain
#' cautious about this.
